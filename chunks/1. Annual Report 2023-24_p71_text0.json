The cycle started with the formation of a Program Team (PT) for preparing the \nSelf-Assessment Report (SAR) as per HEC guidelines. An Assessment Team (AT) is then \nconstituted to evaluate the program through a scheduled visit and submit findings. Based on \nthe AT report, an implementation plan is prepared, followed by periodic QEC reviews to \nensure corrective actions are executed effectively. \n \nDuring the reporting period (2023-24), the self-assessment process for all programs whose \nnext cycle was due were concluded. The table below provides campus-wise details of the \nprograms that went under SAP along with number of corrective actions taken during 2023-\n24 against the findings highlighted by the AT during various AT visits under the process of \nself-assessment.",
