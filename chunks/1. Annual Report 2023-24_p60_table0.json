These \\npolicies \\nfacilitated \\nthe \\nefficient\n                              management of extramural funding, research rewards, research ethics, and intramural\n                             research funding through the Faculty Research Support Grant, catering to both early-\n                         career  and  experienced  researchers.  Additionally,  ORIC  introduced  guidelines  for\n                   international  and  domestic \\ntravel  grants, \\nin-kind \\nresearch  support,  and \\ntechnical\n                   entrepreneurship  initiatives  for  faculty  and  Final  Year  Projects  (FYPs).  Policies  on\n                    plagiarism  and  research  integrity  were  also  reinforced  to  uphold  high  standards  of\n                                                                                    academic honesty and quality.\n                                 These comprehensive measures significantly enhanced the research and development\n                  landscape  at  the  university,  fostering  a  culture  of  transparency,  accountability,  and\n                                                                           excellence in all research activities.\n                •       ORIC  consistently  educated  faculty  members  about  emerging  research  opportunities,\n                         resulting in the submission of over 7 research proposals for external funding during the\n                        2023-2024  period.  This  achievement  is  particularly  notable  given  the  challenging\n                           funding environment, as new grant opportunities during this time were suspended at the\n                                                                   funding agencies end due to shortage of funds.\n                •                                          Fourteen NRPUs were secured in the period 2023 - 2024.\n                •      To  incentivize  and  acknowledge  outstanding  research  publications,  faculty  received\n                         research  rewards  exceeding  Rs.  17.14  million  during  the  period  2023-2024.
