The cycle started with the formation of a Program Team (PT) for preparing the\n         Self-Assessment Report (SAR) as per HEC guidelines. An Assessment Team (AT) is then\n constituted to evaluate the program through a scheduled visit and submit findings. Based on\n      the AT report, an implementation plan is prepared, followed by periodic QEC reviews to\n                                         ensure corrective actions are executed effectively.\n D\\nuring the reporting period (2023-24), the self-assessment process for all programs whose\n      next cycle was due were concluded. The table below provides campus-wise details of the\n     programs that went under SAP along with number of corrective actions taken during 2023-\n 24 against the findings highlighted by the AT during various AT visits under the process of\n                                                                            self-assessment.",
