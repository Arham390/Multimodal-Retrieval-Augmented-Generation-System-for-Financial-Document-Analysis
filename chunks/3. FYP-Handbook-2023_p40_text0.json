Here \nyou should describe the techniques that you used for each \nanalysis and the results of each analysis. \nConclusions are broad generalizations that focus on addressing \nthe questions to answer which the project was undertaken. \nRecommendations are your choices for strategies or tactics \nbased on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to \nspeculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the ﬁndings. \nDo not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that \nyour work cannot clearly support.\nReferences \nThis section should list all existing information sources used in \nthe FYP.  It is important to allow the reader to see all of the \nsources used and enable the reader to further explore these \nsources to verify the information presented.\nAppendix/ces\nThis section should include all supporting information from the \nproject that was not included in the body of the report.  You \nshould include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain \ndetailed tables, and other such information in an appendix.  The \ninformation presented in this section is important to support the \nwork presented in the body of the report but would make it more \ndiﬃcult to read and understand the work if presented within the \nbody of the report. Appendixes may include maps, graphs, \ncharts, or other helpful material.\nCite the appendix items in the report narrative (write \"see \nAppendix A\") and organize appendices (e.g., Appendix A, \nAppendix B, etc.)",
