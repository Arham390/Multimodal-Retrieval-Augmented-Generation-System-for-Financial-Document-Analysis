HEC’s Performance Evaluation comprises of exhaustive \nparameters based on an institution’s efforts towards gaining higher scores under Human \nResecure, Research Management, Collaborations, Innovation & Commercialization.  \n• To meet the accreditation and ranking standards set by the Higher Education \nCommission (HEC), ORIC implemented a series of strategic policies designed to \nstreamline various research processes. These policies facilitated the efficient \nmanagement of extramural funding, research rewards, research ethics, and intramural \nresearch funding through the Faculty Research Support Grant, catering to both early-\ncareer and experienced researchers. Additionally, ORIC introduced guidelines for \ninternational and domestic travel grants, in-kind research support, and technical \nentrepreneurship initiatives for faculty and Final Year Projects (FYPs). Policies on \nplagiarism and research integrity were also reinforced to uphold high standards of \nacademic honesty and quality.  \nThese comprehensive measures significantly enhanced the research and development \nlandscape at the university, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and \nexcellence in all research activities.  \n• ORIC consistently educated faculty members about emerging research opportunities, \nresulting in the submission of over 7 research proposals for external funding during the \n2023-2024 period. This achievement is particularly notable given the challenging \nfunding environment, as new grant opportunities during this time were suspended at the \nfunding agencies end due to shortage of funds. \n• Fourteen NRPUs were secured in the period 2023 - 2024. \n• To incentivize and acknowledge outstanding research publications, faculty received \nresearch rewards exceeding Rs. 17.14 million during the period 2023-2024. This \nprogram has demonstrably led to an increase in the number of high-quality faculty \nimpact factor publications during the reported period. \n• Our campuses have hosted over 440 capacity-building activities for faculty, staff, and \nstudents. These initiatives have provided valuable opportunities for professional \ndevelopment and networking, further enhancing the expertise of them. \n \nCampus Name \nFinancial Year 2023-2024 \nCFD \n48 \nISB \n 285 \nKHI \n57 \nLHR \n43 \nPWR \n7  \nTotal \n440",
