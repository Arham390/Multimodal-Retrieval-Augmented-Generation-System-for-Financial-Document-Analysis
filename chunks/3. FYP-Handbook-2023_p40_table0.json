Here\n           you  should  describe  the  techniques  that  you  used  for  each\n                                   analysis and the results of each analysis.\n               Conclusions are broad generalizations that focus on addressing\n            the  questions  to  answer  which  the  project  was  undertaken.\n            Recommendations  are  your  choices  for  strategies  or  tactics\n                based on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to\n               speculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the ﬁndings.\n                 Do not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that\n                                            your work cannot clearly support.\n                                                                   References\n            This section should list all existing information sources used in\nthe  FYP.    It  is  important  to  allow  the  reader  to  see  all  of  the\n         sources  used  and  enable  the  reader  to  further  explore  these\n                                 sources to verify the information presented.\n                                                                 Appendix/ces\n              This section should include all supporting information from the\n     project  that  was  not  included  in  the  body  of  the  report.   You\n            should include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain\n             detailed tables, and other such information in an appendix.  The\n            information presented in this section is important to support the\n              work presented in the body of the report but would make it more\n              diﬃcult to read and understand the work if presented within the\n             body  of  the  report.  Appendixes  may  include  maps,  graphs,\n                                           charts, or other helpful material.\n         Cite  the  appendix  items  in  the  report  narrative  (write  \"see\n               Appendix  A\")  and  organize  appendices  (e.g.,  Appendix  A,\n                                                            Appendix B, etc.)",
