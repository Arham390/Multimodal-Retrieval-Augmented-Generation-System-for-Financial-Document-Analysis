These \nguidelines provide a robust framework for maintaining and enhancing the quality of higher \neducation and research programs across the university. \n \nThe NUCES QA Policy is meticulously aligned with QAA’s guidelines to ensure that the \nuniversity consistently adheres to the highest quality standards. The policy not only defines \nthe procedures and processes for maintaining academic excellence but also establishes \nmechanisms for continuous improvement to meet or exceed the expectations outlined by the \nHEC. \n \nIn addition to adhering to QAA and HEC guidelines, the QA Policy integrates NUCES’ \ninternal policies and regulations. By using HEC’s directives as a foundational reference, \nNUCES continuously evolves its quality assurance framework, incorporating newly \ndeveloped practices and innovations that enhance the effectiveness of its academic and \nadministrative processes. \n \nDevelopment of Faculty Mentoring Policy \n \nAs part of its commitment to faculty development, the National University of Computer and \nEmerging Sciences (NUCES) has formalized its efforts through the development of a \ncomprehensive Faculty Mentoring Policy. While NUCES has long facilitated faculty \ngrowth through participation in various opportunities and in-house training workshops, \nthese efforts were previously informal. Recognizing the importance of structured initiatives, \nthe university has introduced a dedicated Faculty Development Program to achieve more \nimpactful and measurable outcomes. \n \nThe Faculty Development Program focuses on two key goals \n \n1. Faculty Mentoring Supporting newly hired and relatively junior faculty members in \nadapting to the academic environment and excelling in their roles. \n2. Faculty Training Providing professional development opportunities to enhance the \nknowledge, skills, and competencies of faculty members at all levels. \n \nThis initiative underscores NUCES’ commitment to fostering a culture of excellence and \ncontinuous learning among its faculty, ensuring their growth aligns with the university’s \nmission of academic and research distinction. \n \nDevelopment of Policy for Best University Teacher Award \n \nThe National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) has introduced \nthe Best Teacher Award to recognize outstanding faculty members and promote excellence \nin teaching. The award aims to motivate faculty to enhance their teaching practices and \nprofessional skills. It is open to all full-time faculty members, from Lecturer to Professor, \nand evaluations are conducted over an academic year (July–June) to ensure a thorough and \nfair process.",
