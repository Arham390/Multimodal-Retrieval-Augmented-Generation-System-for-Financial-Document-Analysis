End notes are like \nfootnotes but are located at the back rather than the bottom of \neach page. These would include all of the references for all works \ncited in the review of related literature or any other sections of the \nreport as well as the references for quotations, either direct or \nindirect, taken from other sources, or any footnote comments that \nmight have been included. These are listed in numeric order as \npresented in the text. \n1. Lani Arredondo (1999) Business Presentations, \nMcGraw-Hill, pp. 23-34.\n2. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, \nAustralia, p. 23.\n3. Paul Tench (1981) Pronunciation Skills, \nMacmillan, p. 23.\nIn case an endnote is followed by another citing the same source, \nonly the word: “Ibid” (as above) shall substitute for the entire \ntext. If the page no. is diﬀerent, then the page number shall \nappear after the word: “Ibid”. For example:\n1. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, Australia,  \np. 23.\n    Ibid., p. 54.\nIn case the same source comes to be mentioned after a few \ninterrupting sources, then the word “op cit” would suﬃce \n(mentioned earlier is written), followed by the page number.\nBibliography or Literature Cited\nBibliography will appear in alphabetic order of the authors' \nsurnames. Author's surname shall come ﬁrst as is the case in the \ncatalogues of libraries.",
