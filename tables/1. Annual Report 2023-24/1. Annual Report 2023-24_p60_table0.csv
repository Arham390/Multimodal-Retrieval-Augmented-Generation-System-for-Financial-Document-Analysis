ccomplishments",
N,oteworthy achievements of our department include
•,The ORIC has submitted the HEC’s Annual Score Card and anticipated to improve its
,"ranking  from  ""Y""  to  ‘X’.  HEC’s  Performance  Evaluation  comprises  of  exhaustive"
,parameters based on an institution’s efforts towards gaining higher scores under Human
,"Resecure, Research Management, Collaborations, Innovation & Commercialization."
•,"To  meet 
the  accreditation  and 
ranking 
standards  set  by 
the  Higher  Education"
,"Commission  (HEC),  ORIC  implemented  a  series  of  strategic  policies  designed  to"
,"streamline 
various 
research 
processes.  These 
policies 
facilitated 
the 
efficient"
,"management of extramural funding, research rewards, research ethics, and intramural"
,"research funding through the Faculty Research Support Grant, catering to both early-"
,"career  and  experienced  researchers.  Additionally,  ORIC  introduced  guidelines  for"
,"international  and  domestic 
travel  grants, 
in-kind 
research  support,  and 
technical"
,entrepreneurship  initiatives  for  faculty  and  Final  Year  Projects  (FYPs).  Policies  on
,plagiarism  and  research  integrity  were  also  reinforced  to  uphold  high  standards  of
,academic honesty and quality.
,These comprehensive measures significantly enhanced the research and development
,"landscape  at  the  university,  fostering  a  culture  of  transparency,  accountability,  and"
,excellence in all research activities.
•,"ORIC  consistently  educated  faculty  members  about  emerging  research  opportunities,"
,resulting in the submission of over 7 research proposals for external funding during the
,2023-2024  period.  This  achievement  is  particularly  notable  given  the  challenging
,"funding environment, as new grant opportunities during this time were suspended at the"
,funding agencies end due to shortage of funds.
•,Fourteen NRPUs were secured in the period 2023 - 2024.
•,"To  incentivize  and  acknowledge  outstanding  research  publications,  faculty  received"
,research  rewards  exceeding  Rs.  17.14  million  during  the  period  2023-2024.  This
,program  has  demonstrably  led  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  high-quality  faculty
,impact factor publications during the reported period.
•,"Our campuses have hosted over 440 capacity-building activities for faculty, staff, and"
,students. These initiatives have provided valuable opportunities for professional
,"development and networking, further enhancing the expertise of them."
